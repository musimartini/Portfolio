# ABOUT ME

My name is Martyna. I am an Applied Mathematics graduate and machine learning enthusiast. I love exploring new mathematical fields, finding hidden patterns and solving difficult
problems. I like to play cooperative
and logic board games, which help
me develop strategic thinking and
collaboration skills.

I am currently working in the
insurance industry, where my
responsibilities include data mining,
analysis and interpretation, building
and maintaining risk models and also
monthly reporting. My job is not just a duty but also a pleasure, as it allows me to engage daily in what I love most - mathematics, data analysis and problem solving.

My lifeâ€™s goal is to share my passion and show the beauty of mathematics, inspire and motivate other people, especially younger ones (e.g. during popular science events). Currently, I am focusing on my personal development, including data scientist skills.
