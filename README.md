# Portfolio

My name is Martyna Maksimowicz. I am an Applied Mathematics graduate and machine learning enthusiast. I love exploring new mathematical fields, finding hidden patterns and solving difficult problems. My lifeâ€™s goal is to share my passion and show the beauty of mathematics, inspire and motivate other people, especially younger ones (e.g. during popular science events). Currently, I am focusing on my personal development, including data scientist skills.
